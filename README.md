## Overview
Welcome to the 2025 Kaggle Playground Series! We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting and approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

### Your Goal: Predict the likelihood of accidents on different types of roads.

For this Playground Series challenge, we have teamed up with Stack Overflow to give you a two-part challenge. The Stack Overflow Challenge is the second part and builds upon this one by having participants develop a web application. We encourage you to check out the Stack Overflow Challenge!

If you complete both challenges, we’ll recognize your breadth of skills with a special “Code Scientist” badge which will appear on both Kaggle and Stack Overflow.
